The Blockgroup ID is constructed by combining State FIPS code, County FIPS code,  Tract ID, and block group ID.
For "Block Group 2, Census Tract 9442.01, Apache County, Arizona.”, the Block Group ID will be “0400194442012”.  
The first 2-digits is the State FIPS code. Arizona is “04”. 
The following 3-digits is the county FIPS. 
Apache county is “001”. The census Tract ID is “944201, and the block group 2 is the last digit.


Had to change "Ñ" to spaces in variables.csv.
